Hello and Welcome!

With this Easy and Fast Menu, you can setup a nice and very functional menu in just a few minutes.

All you need to do is add the "oMenuControl" to your menu room and then configure it in the "Create" event.

It's highly customizable and easy to do so. 

IMPORTANT: in the step event, in the "cases" of "switch(selected)", you must enter the code of what the menu will do.
